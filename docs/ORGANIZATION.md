├── README.md              # Documentation index (start here)
├── setup/                 # Setup and configuration guides
├── testing/                # Testing guides and references
├── development/            # Development workflow and conventions
├── deployment/             # Deployment guides
├── technical/              # Technical documentation
└── debugging/              # Debugging guides
```
